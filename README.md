This is my first attempt at creating a cheat for [The Headliners](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3059070/The_Headliners/), an Unreal Engine 5 game. I’m aware the code is rough and has redundancies. I might continue working on this when I’m bored. 

## 📋 Requirements  
Ensure you meet the following requirements before using this cheat:  
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)  
- A copy of *The Headliners* on Steam

## 💉 Injection Methods  
To inject the cheat, you can either:  
- Develop or use your own custom injector
