## 📌 Overview
My first ever attempt at making a cheat for Unreal Engine 5 Game ["The Headliners"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3059070/The_Headliners/).

### 📋 Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- "The Headliners" on Steam
- [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

### 💉 Injection Methods
